Wow! You Won! Great Job. Thank you so much for playing my game. I really hope that you enjoyed playing. I really had fun making this game. I owe a lot of this game to Simply Coding. I a plugin provided by them, which made making this A LOT easier.<a href="https://www.simplycoding.org/"> Click Here</a> to visit the simply coding website. I really love coding, and without Simply Coding, I would know little of coding that I do today. I recomment visiting their website. I hope to make more games in the future, so if I have come out with those yet, I'd recommend playing. <div id="a">Th</div><div id="b">an</div><div id="c">ks</div> <div id="d">Fo</div><div id="e">r P</div><div id="f">la</div><div id="g">yi</div><div id="h">ng</div><div id="i">!!</div>
