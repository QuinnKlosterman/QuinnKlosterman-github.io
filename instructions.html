	<h1>Wecome</h1>
	<p>Welcome to my brand new version of Boss Rush! This is essentially my original boss rush game, but way better. I a lot of fun making it and I hope that You enjoy playing.</p>
	<h1>Controls</h1>
	<p>To move, use the arrow keys. To shoot, use the space bar. If you are reading this, you should have played my first game, but it is too late now. You have commited to this. NO TURNING BACK!!!</p>
	<h4>There are some new machanics in this game, so be prepared to see the lose screen a lot. Just as a heads up, the movement is randomized and a ton of new abilities were added. So essentially, don't use the same strategy that you might have used for the first one.</h4>
